Not using this tool, I wasted several hours trying to understand why simple configurations gave problems, it turns out that the most recent versions of the harbor bring thousands of problems that make common use practically unstable.

In my case, I tried to setup it in Helm and it gave me a lot of problems, I didn't try it in Docker because it would go beyond my scope.
